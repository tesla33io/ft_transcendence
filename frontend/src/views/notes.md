# Question 
1. when joining Tounranament i get this message:
Game data: 
{status: 'waiting', playerId: '38415', message: 'Waiting for player... (1/4)'}
message
: 
"Waiting for player... (1/4)"
playerId
: 
"38415"
status
: 
"waiting"
[[Prototype]]

But i do not get update when a second player joins only for the second player:

{status: 'waiting', playerId: '40717', message: 'Waiting for player... (2/4)'}
message
: 
"Waiting for player... (2/4)"
playerId
: 
"40717"
status
: 
"waiting"
[[Prototype]]
: 
Object

Is it a bug that i do not see the 2 out of 4 message not immpoertend but would be nice for progress bar rendering.
