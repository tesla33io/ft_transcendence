## Feature Description
Implement a comprehensive avatar management system allowing users to upload custom avatars with fallback to default options, as required by the ft_transcendence subject.

## Requirements
- [ ] Users can upload an avatar image
- [ ] Default avatar option if none is provided
- [ ] Image validation and processing (size, format, dimensions)
- [ ] Secure file storage management
- [ ] Avatar retrieval and display across the platform

## Implementation Steps

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] **Database Schema Updates**
  - Add `avatar_url` column to users table
  - Add `avatar_upload_date` column for tracking
  - Add `has_custom_avatar` boolean flag

- [ ] **File Upload Infrastructure**
  - Install and configure multer or similar for file uploads
  - Create `uploads/avatars/` directory structure with proper permissions
  - Implement file validation (type: PNG/JPEG/WebP, size: max 5MB, dimensions)
  - Add image processing (resize to 256x256, compress, format conversion)

- [ ] **Avatar API Endpoints**
  - `POST /api/v1/users/me/avatar` - Upload avatar with multipart/form-data
  - `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/avatar` - Remove custom avatar, revert to default
  - `GET /api/v1/users/:id/avatar` - Get user avatar (with caching headers)
  - `GET /api/v1/avatars/default` - Get default avatar options

- [ ] **Avatar Processing Service**
  - Implement image resizing to standard dimensions (256x256)
  - Convert images to efficient format (WebP with JPEG fallback)
  - Generate thumbnail versions (64x64, 128x128)
  - Add virus scanning for uploaded files (ClamAV integration)
  - Implement cleanup for old avatar files

- [ ] **Default Avatar System**
  - Create set of 8-10 default avatar options
  - Implement avatar generation from user initials
  - Random avatar assignment for new users
  - Ensure default avatars are properly styled

### Frontend Implementation
- [ ] **Avatar Upload Component**
  - Drag-and-drop file upload interface with visual feedback
  - Image preview before upload with crop functionality
  - Upload progress indication with cancel option
  - Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly validation messages
  - File format and size guidance

- [ ] **Avatar Display Components**
  - Consistent avatar component for user profiles
  - Tournament participant avatar display
  - Friend list avatar integration
  - Responsive sizing (small: 32px, medium: 64px, large: 128px, profile: 256px)
  - Loading states and fallback handling

- [ ] **Avatar Management Interface**
  - Current avatar display in user profile settings
  - Default avatar selection gallery
  - Avatar change history (if applicable)
  - Privacy settings for avatar visibility

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - Image processing functions
  - File validation logic
  - Default avatar generation
  - Avatar URL generation and cleanup

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - Avatar upload API endpoint testing
  - File storage and retrieval
  - Database integration
  - Authentication and authorization

- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**
  - Complete avatar upload workflow
  - Avatar display across different components
  - Default avatar assignment for new users
  - Avatar deletion and cleanup

- [ ] **Performance Tests**
  - Large file upload handling
  - Multiple concurrent uploads
  - Image processing performance
  - Storage cleanup efficiency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully upload image files (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- [ ] Uploaded images are automatically resized to 256x256 pixels
- [ ] File size validation prevents uploads larger than 5MB
- [ ] Invalid file types are rejected with clear error messages
- [ ] Default avatars are automatically assigned to new users
- [ ] Avatars display correctly and consistently across all UI components
- [ ] Users can remove custom avatars and revert to default options
- [ ] Proper error handling for network issues, server errors, and invalid uploads
- [ ] Avatar changes are reflected immediately across the platform
- [ ] File storage is secure and organized with proper cleanup

## Dependencies
- [ ] Issue #7: Database schema improvements (users table updates)
- [ ] Issue #5: User CRUD operations (profile management integration)
- [ ] File storage infrastructure (local or cloud storage setup)
- [ ] Image processing libraries (sharp, imagemagick, or similar)

## Estimated Effort
**2-3 weeks** (including testing and optimization)

### Breakdown:
- Backend implementation: 1.5 weeks
- Frontend implementation: 1 week
- Testing and optimization: 0.5 weeks

## Additional Notes

### Security Considerations:
- Implement proper file type validation to prevent executable uploads
- Sanitize uploaded file names
- Use virus scanning for uploaded content
- Implement rate limiting for upload endpoints
- Store avatars outside web root or use secure serving mechanism

### Performance Considerations:
- Implement image compression to reduce storage and bandwidth
- Use CDN for avatar serving if possible
- Implement proper caching headers for avatar requests
- Consider lazy loading for avatar galleries

### Storage Strategy:
- Local storage: `backend/uploads/avatars/{userId}/avatar.{ext}`
- Cloud storage option: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar
- Database storage: Only store metadata, not binary data
- Backup strategy for avatar files

### Default Avatar Options:
1. Geometric patterns (8 different designs)
2. Initial-based avatars with colored backgrounds
3. Abstract art avatars
4. Simple icon-based avatars

### File Processing Pipeline:
1. Upload validation (type, size)
2. Virus scanning
3. Image processing (resize, compress)
4. Storage with unique naming
5. Database update with avatar URL
6. Old file cleanup (if replacing existing avatar)

### Integration Points:
- User registration: Assign default avatar
- Profile management: Avatar change interface
- Tournament display: Show participant avatars
- Friends system: Display friend avatars
- Admin panel: Avatar management and moderation

This feature is essential for user identity and platform engagement, providing users with personalization options while maintaining system security and performance.
