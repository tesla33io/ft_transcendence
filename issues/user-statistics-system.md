## Feature Description
Implement a robust statistics tracking system for user profiles displaying wins, losses, and detailed performance metrics, as required by the ft_transcendence subject.

## Requirements
- [ ] Track wins and losses for 1v1 games
- [ ] Calculate and display win/loss ratios and percentages
- [ ] Track tournament performance and achievements
- [ ] Display comprehensive statistics on user profiles
- [ ] Historical statistics tracking and trending
- [ ] Real-time statistics updates after each game

## Implementation Steps

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] **Database Schema Updates**
  - Create `user_statistics` table with comprehensive metrics
  - Add columns: `total_games`, `wins`, `losses`, `draws`, `win_percentage`
  - Add tournament stats: `tournaments_played`, `tournaments_won`, `tournament_win_rate`
  - Add performance metrics: `average_score`, `highest_score`, `average_game_duration`
  - Add streak tracking: `current_win_streak`, `best_win_streak`, `current_loss_streak`
  - Add time-based stats: `games_this_week`, `games_this_month`, `total_playtime`
  - Add ranking metrics: `current_rank`, `highest_rank`, `rank_points`

- [ ] **Statistics Calculation Service**
  - Real-time statistics updates triggered by game completion
  - Batch statistics recalculation system for data consistency
  - Performance metrics calculation algorithms (averages, percentages, trends)
  - Historical statistics aggregation by time periods
  - Rank calculation based on win rate and game difficulty
  - Statistical anomaly detection for fraud prevention

- [ ] **Statistics API Endpoints**
  - `GET /api/v1/users/:id/stats` - Get comprehensive user statistics
  - `GET /api/v1/users/:id/stats/summary` - Get condensed statistics for displays
  - `GET /api/v1/users/:id/stats/history` - Get historical statistics with time filters
  - `GET /api/v1/users/:id/stats/trends` - Get performance trends and analytics
  - `GET /api/v1/leaderboard` - Global leaderboard with filtering options
  - `GET /api/v1/leaderboard/friends/:userId` - Friend-only leaderboard
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/stats/recalculate` - Admin statistics recalculation
  - `GET /api/v1/stats/global` - Platform-wide statistics

- [ ] **Game Integration Service**
  - Hook statistics updates into game completion events
  - Handle different game types (1v1, tournament, practice)
  - Support for different game modes and difficulty levels
  - Undo statistics for cancelled or disputed games
  - Batch processing for tournament completion
  - Performance impact monitoring and optimization

### Frontend Implementation

    - Visual progress bars and percentage displays
    - Achievement badges and milestones

  - **Interactive Charts and Graphs**
    - Win/loss ratio pie charts
    - Performance trends line graphs (last 7 days, 30 days, all time)
    - Game frequency histograms
    - Score distribution charts
    - Rank progression over time

  - **Leaderboard Interface**
    - Global leaderboard with pagination and search
    - Friend leaderboards for social competition
    - Filtering options (time period, game type, tournament vs 1v1)
    - User rank display with position changes
    - Statistics comparison between users

- [ ] **Statistics Management Interface**
  - **Personal Statistics Dashboard**
    - Comprehensive view of all personal statistics
    - Time period filtering (week, month, year, all time)
    - Goal setting and progress tracking
    - Export functionality for statistics data
    - Privacy settings for statistics visibility

  - **Performance Analytics**
    - Strengths and weaknesses analysis
    - Opponent analysis (common opponents, win rates)
    - Time-based performance patterns
    - Improvement suggestions based on statistics
    - Achievement tracking and notifications

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - Statistics calculation accuracy tests
  - Percentage and ratio computation tests
  - Ranking algorithm tests
  - Time-based aggregation tests
  - Edge case handling (division by zero, negative values)

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - Game completion to statistics update flow
  - Real-time statistics update testing
  - Database transaction consistency tests
  - API endpoint response validation
  - Leaderboard ranking accuracy tests

- [ ] **Performance Tests**
  - Statistics calculation performance with large datasets
  - Real-time update performance under load
  - Leaderboard query performance with many users
  - Historical data aggregation performance
  - Concurrent statistics update handling

- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**
  - Complete game-to-statistics workflow
  - Leaderboard updates after game completion
  - Statistics display across different user interfaces
  - Privacy settings impact on statistics visibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User statistics are accurately updated after each completed game
- [ ] Statistics display wins, losses, draws, and calculated win percentage
- [ ] Tournament statistics are tracked separately from regular games
- [ ] Performance metrics (average score, streaks) are calculated and displayed
- [ ] Historical statistics are maintained and accessible
- [ ] Leaderboard reflects accurate and current statistics
- [ ] Statistics update in real-time or near real-time (within 30 seconds)
- [ ] Users can view their statistics history with time filtering
- [ ] Privacy controls allow users to hide statistics from other users
- [ ] Statistical data is consistent across all platform displays

## Dependencies
- [ ] Issue #7: Database schema improvements (statistics tables)
- [ ] Game engine integration for statistics triggers
- [ ] Issue #5: User CRUD operations (profile statistics display)
- [ ] Issue #6: Friends management (friend leaderboards)
- [ ] Tournament system integration (tournament statistics)

## Estimated Effort
**2-3 weeks** (including comprehensive testing and optimization)
