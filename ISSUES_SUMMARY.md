## 🔧 Technical Stack Considerations

Based on the current repository setup:

### Backend:
- **Framework**: Fastify (Node.js)
- **Database**: SQLite with potential for PostgreSQL migration
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **File Upload**: Multer or similar multipart handler
- **Real-time**: @fastify/websocket
- **Image Processing**: Sharp or similar library

### Frontend: 
- Framework needs to be determined (React, Vue, or vanilla JS)
- WebSocket client for real-time features
- File upload components
- Chart libraries for statistics visualization

## 📝 Customization Notes

Each issue file contains:
- **Detailed implementation steps** - Modify based on your tech stack
- **Acceptance criteria** - Adjust based on your requirements  
- **Time estimates** - Update based on your team's velocity
- **Dependencies** - Verify against your project structure
- **Technical details** - Adapt to your specific implementation choices

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

1. **Review existing codebase** before implementation to avoid conflicts
2. **Coordinate with team members** to prevent duplicate work
3. **Consider your deployment environment** (single server vs distributed)
4. **Plan for scalability** based on expected user load
5. **Security review** all user input handling and file uploads
6. **Performance testing** especially for real-time features and file handling

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Review each issue file in detail
2. Customize content for your specific needs
3. Create GitHub issues using the provided templates
4. Assign priorities and milestones
5. Begin implementation with database schema improvements
6. Set up project board for tracking progress
